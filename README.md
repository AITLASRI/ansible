# ANSIBLE

Ansible is an open-source software provisioning, configuration management, and application-deployment tool. It runs on many Unix-like systems, and can configure both Unix-like systems as well as Microsoft Windows.

Ansible is written in Python and uses YAML files to describe configuration policies. These policies are then interpreted and enforced by the Ansible command-line tool.

One of the key features of Ansible is its simplicity. It uses an easy-to-learn syntax and does not require a central server to manage the infrastructure. Instead, it relies on SSH for communication and control. This makes it easy to set up and get started with, as there is no need to install any additional software on managed nodes.


Ansible is particularly useful for automating tasks such as:
  - Installing and configuring software
  - Managing system configurations
  - Deploying applications
  - Provisioning infrastructure


Ansible also provides support for various other functionality, such as:
  - Parallel execution of tasks
  - Variable substitution
  - Conditionals
  - Looping
  
  Overall, Ansible is a powerful and flexible tool that can help you automate and manage your infrastructure and applications more effectively.
